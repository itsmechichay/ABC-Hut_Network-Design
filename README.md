# ABC-Hut_Network-Design
Network Design for ABC Hut, Floor 31

## A. Project Design Description

The increase in the number of overseas and nearby provinces enrollees in ABC School paved the way for the planning of constructing a 47-story condominium unit. This building, ABC Hut, will consist of various facilities and amenities. These would include parking, an amusement center, cafes, recreational hubs, a chapel, a swimming pool, laundry, medical and dental clinics, a spa, and the rest are studio-type rooms. With this plan, it cannot be completed without a network plan for each floor and facility as all floors are planned to be internet-ready both wired and wireless.

In this paper, the assignment is floor 31 which consists of six (6) studio-type rooms, each accommodating four (4) students. Considering the number of rooms, each will have its own Local Area Network (LAN), and the connections are available wired and wirelessly (WLAN).

To achieve an efficient yet cost-effective connection, the network design would include a router, switches, a hub, access points, and cables. Using one router with high bandwidth can handle all rooms for the assigned floor. This can potentially maximize the connections in the router. With this concept, it also aims to consider the possible additional number of connections, which will depend on the materials and devices used in setting up the network. The use of a hub and access points is to minimize the possible cost while maximizing an efficient connection.

## B. Design Materials and Costing
The network design plan is applicable for six rooms with a designated LAN for each room in floor 31. The chosen components are ready for possible additional connections, wired or wirelessly to achieve scalability. With this, the table that follows shows the proposed materials, its quantity, the cost, and the overall total for the network design.

| Item No. | Materials | Quantity | Cost | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Router | 1 | 42,258.24 | 42,258.24 |
| 2 | Hub | 1 | 1,157.76 | 1,157.76 |
| 3 | Switch | 6 | 20,260.80 | 121,564.80 |
| 4 | Access Point | 6 | 1,157.76 | 6,946.56 |
| 5 | Straight-through Cable (200ft) | 1 | 1797.81 | 3,595.62 |
| 6 | Crossover Cable (200ft) | 1 | 1855.82 | 3,711.64 |
| **Total** |  |  |  | **â‚±179,234.62** |
